# API Reference

Directus offers both a RESTful and GraphQL API to manage the data in the database. The API has
predictable resource-oriented URLs, relies on standard HTTP status codes, and uses JSON for input
and output.

The input/output of the API differs greatly for individual installs, as most of the endpoints will
return data that's based on your specific schema.
