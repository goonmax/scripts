# Technical Support

> Directus is offered completely free and open-source for anyone wishing to self-host the platform.
> There are many resources, both free and paid, to help you get up-and-running smoothly.

## Community Support

[Github Discussions](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions) is great first place to reach
out for help. Our community and core developers often check this platform and answer posts. It has
the added benefit of being an archival resource for others developers with similar questions.

Our [Discord](https://directus.chat) community is another great way to get assistance. Please keep
all questions on the `#help` channel, be considerate, and remember that you are getting free help 
from the community for a free product.

## Premium Support

Premium support is included with our Enterprise Cloud service. On-Demand Cloud customers and
On-Premise users interested in learning more about our monthly retainer agreements should contact us
at [support@directus.io](mailto:support@directus.io).

## Sponsored Work

### Commissioned Features

If you need a specific feature added to Directus faster than the normal development timeline,
[reach out to us](https://directus.io/contact/) for a quote. Our parent agency will often help
subsidize the cost of developing new features if they pass our
[80/20 Rule](/getting-started/contributing) and can be merged into the core codebase. Other
custom/proprietary development will be built bespoke within our robust extension system.

### Expedited Fixes

We triage all reported bugs based on priority and how long the fix is estimated to take. If you need
a specific issue resolved sooner, [reach out to us](https://directus.io/contact/) for a quote.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<!--
@TODO
### Does Directus handle deploying or migrating projects?

Directus includes [export](#) and [backup](#) tools to assist in deploying data changes between
environments (eg: from _development_ to _production_), however there is no formal migration
workflow.

Additionally, since Directus stores all of your data in pure SQL, you can use almost any preexisting
workflow or toolkit for this process. -->

### Does Directus support Mongo/NoSQL?

Not currently. Directus has been built specifically for wrapping _relational_ databases. While we
could force Mongo to use tables, columns, and rows via Mongoose object modeling, that approach to
non-structured doesn't make a lot of sense. We realize many users are interested in this feature,
and will continue to explore its possibility.

### Why haven't you added this feature, or fixed that issue yet?

Directus is primarily a free and open-source project, maintained by a small core team and community
contributors who donate their time and resources.

Our platform is feature-rich, however we strictly adhere to our
[80/20 Rule](/getting-started/contributing) to avoid a messy/bloated codebase. Directus is also
quite stable, however new issues still arise, some of which may be triaged with a lower
prioritization.

If you require more expeditious updates, you can contact us regarding
[sponsoring expedited fixes](#expedited-fixes) or
[commissioning new features](#commissioned-features). You can also
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/directus/directus/pulls) â€” after all, it is open-source!

### Can you give an ETA for this feature/fix?

If it is sponsored work, then yes, delivery dates are part of our statement of work agreements.
Otherwise, most likely not. This is open-source software, work is prioritized internally, and all
timelines are subject to change.

### But this is an emergency, my very important project requires it now!

We understand, and are here to help. If you need something prioritized, you can reach out to us to
discuss [premium support](#premium-support), [sponsoring expedited fixes](#expedited-features) or
[commissioning new features](#commissioned-features).
